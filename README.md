# Spotify-Data-Project
Using R, we took a data set from Kaylin Pavlik who used the spotifyr package to collect 5000 songs across 6 genres. We then cleaned up the data set and extracted certain variables to create a graph of popularity over time to analyze trends.
We then used markdown in R to create an html document in chrome so the data and graphs can be interpreted in a more visually appealing fashion.
The Chrome html document can either be opened directly or opened through R with the markdown file.
An image of the graph has also been uploaded along with the other files.
