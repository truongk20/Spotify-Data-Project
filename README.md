# Spotify-Data-Project
Using R, we took a data set from Kaylin Pavlik who used the spotifyr package to collect 5000 songs across 6 genres. The dataset can be found here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md
<br /> We then cleaned up the data set and extracted certain variables to create a graph of popularity over time to analyze trends.
We then used markdown in R to create an HTML document in chrome so the data and graphs can be interpreted in a more visually appealing fashion. <br />
TO OPEN THE COMPLETED PROJECT: Download the spotify songs dataset and open the .rmd file. In the taskbar, click knit to HTML, it will then open up a HTML where you can view the completed project. <br />
An image of the graph has also been uploaded along with the other files.
